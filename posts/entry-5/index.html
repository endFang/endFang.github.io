And funny story: Origin provides the full content in tis demo except .exe file. Steam provides partial but with .exe file. 3DM cracked the game by playing steam’s .exe into Origin’s folder. And the game worked.\nFFXIV: Seal Rock I transferred to Immortal Flames for winning more. It turned out that Flames doesn’t win that much all the time. Then I waited 1 week to transfer back, and I won 20 times in a week. It doesn’t matter now, I have the glamour now.\nFFXV Royal Edition: main game I dowloaded the pre-load but didn’t realize un-packing also needed almost 3 hours. The game’s graphic quality (get out of my mind Kyle!) is almost the same to the PS4. But I think this is because I cannot tell the differences between them.\nNew cutscenes are added, but I believe most of them are clips from Kingsglaive the movie. Why? Because Lunafreya’s model is different! Lunafreay in Kingsgalive is not the same person as in the FFXV game. It’s quiet disgusting that players are not allowed to save inside the dungeon. I almost made to the end of the cannel. Then I couldn’t save my progression to do my homework. All my efforts are wasted, and everything will restart again the next time.\nFFXV Royal Edition: Comrade A youtuber comments that Comrade’s update is way more better than Royal Edition. I haven’t play this game more than 1 year, so I don’t know the differences.\nComrade’s story happens after Noctis disappeared in the crystal. I need to party with other players (or A.I.) to complete quests, which are basically hunts, and to progress the story. Quests’ rewards are Power and gils. Power is used to unlock quests, hunts, treasures, Sigils. etc..\nThe game’s plot is a a short story revealing how people defend the darkness when their King is gone and Kingsglaive’s betray and trial.\nWeapons can be remodeled by adding specific stats. Some weapon can upgraded to Lv.99. Most are only Lv.60. Stats are customizable and decided by the player. I made a Wizard Shield with full elemental resistance and almost 200 magic. Due to this mechanism, the player can have varied builds.\nComrades is essentially another individual game in my opinion. It has completed system and story, a very short one thought. However, the matchmaking system does not work properly and the play base is extremely small. I’ve been playing Comrades since March 6th, but I barely meet other players. In addition, most of the content can be soloed with A.I.. I dare say people would rather play it offline.\nFFXIV: Eureka, The Forbidden Land My impression to Eureka: fate train.\nEureka is separated from the main game. Every player has elemental level in Eureka, which can be maxed to Lv.20. Random mobs drop Protean Crystal, while Fate drops Anemous Crystal. Crystals are currency for upgrading AF3 gears from iv.290 to ilv.350(weapon is 355).\nAfter the first 3 days complain and whine , people figured out fate windows, spawning requirements, and Pazuzu feathers. An website tracking fate was also created. ( I hope I did.)\nThe optimal way of leveling and gaining crystals is fate train. Each Eureka instance allows 144 players to exist. Players gather together to do fate one by one. When they move from one place to another, an interesting “train” will appear.\nPeople complained a lot about Eureka on forum, reddit, twitter, and any other platforms, but I do like Eureka more than other content. Eureka makes FFXIV become more alive and MMO-ish. Ever since 3.55, most players have optimal gears and tend to pull big in dungeons. They spend most of time to idle in Idyllshire and there main cities. It created an illusion of being comfortable and the impatience. It can be proved that in 4.0’s leveling dungeons, every tank tried to pull big and blame healers/dps for doing less damage, because that’s what they did in 3.4 - 3.5. Pulling big became an issue. Now we’re at end game again (3.2) and the same situation is happening. The game is too comfortable.\nBut Eureka is different. It has individual level system and enemies. Dangerous mobs dealing fatal damage are walking around near the beginning port. Players must level up first to explore the area. Even thought it is possible to sneak past mobs, players need to be certain level to use Aetheryte or summon mount. Among other things, flying mount is forbidden. In such a way, Eureka creates an beautiful but also dangerous area. Players need to cooperate to do Eureka, so the “fate train” begins. I’ve never seen this many alive players ever since I’ve stop leveling by fate.\nAnother thing, this might the easiest 1st stage of relic so far. I only need to farming crystals.\nIs Eureka that toxic and bad? No, I don’t think so, but I do think there are place for improvement.\n","wordCount":"879","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2018-04-01T22:18:20+08:00","dateModified":"2018-04-01T22:18:20+08:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kyle Fang"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://endfang.github.io/posts/entry-5/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"After1995","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://endfang.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script>
