The heartless life likes to mock us. It made us meet each other, yet give us so little time.
His brown-ish yellow eyes are beautiful. I can see me reflected in his eyes. His hands are bigger than mine and can easily hold mine. He likes kissing. His kiss is sweet, wet and cool, probably because he likes to chew gums. He likes nature and walking around in the park.">

<p>7.20</p>
<p>大早上的很凉快。火车上没什么人。要到 Macomb 的人屈指可数。
Mr. David 的身上有着很好闻的古龙水香味。他的胡茬很刺人。他有着黄铜色的眼睛。他的右眼天生就没有视力。
下午快三点的时候我们才出门，他请我吃了柠檬冰淇淋和自助餐。
<img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/EiFdJpq.jpg alt=lemon_icecream>
</p>
<p>密西西比河很宽阔，河边倒都是泥巴。
他的体温比我高，而且他尝起来很甜。</p>
<p>7.21</p>
<p>Mr. David 一大早就出门去了教堂演奏。我悄悄摸摸的溜进来最后一排。
也就是下午快三点的时候我们才出门。他带我去了森林散步。河边有一张小桌子。他说每到秋天的时候，从这里可以看到河对面的树林从绿色转为黄色再转为红色。
他很容易就睡着了，我的手臂可以感受到他的呼吸。</p>
<p>7.22</p>
<p>Mr. David 的手很大，而且凉凉的。
芝加哥实际上是在湖边。
<img loading=lazy src=https://i.imgur.com/GlXvTjh.jpg alt=chicago_lake>
</p>
<p>Sky Wheel 转了三圈。我真的很怕高。焦糖爆米花和芝士爆米花，一种甜一种咸，两种味道在嘴里一起混杂，嘴巴很难停下来。
焦糖味在芝加哥的宾馆里弥漫。</p>
<p>7.23</p>
<p>这几天起床都很早，而且很温暖，今天也不例外。
分别后刚开始还没什么。两三个小时后是真疼啊。</p>
