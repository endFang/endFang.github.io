<p>WoD heads back to the First and is informed that a new crystal vessel storing soul is invented to help Scions go back to the Source.</p>
<p>After WoD cleaned Warriors of Light&rsquo;s name by telling the truth behind the Floor, Elidibus possessed Ardbert&rsquo;s body to encourage everyone to become a Warrior of Light. He also created an illusion of the meteor shower to invoke many people&rsquo;s Echo. It turned out every sundered soul of ancient has remaining Echo inside. Seeing the Final Days will awake such power and make them hear Hydaelyn&rsquo;s calling.</p>
<p>Many citizens in Crystarium decide to start their adventure and left their job and duty behind. To reveal Elidibus' true intention on creating more Warrior of Light, WoD and Scions explored Anamnesis Anyder and discovered that Venat and Elidibus both sacrificed to become the heart Hydaelyn and Zodiark&rsquo;s heart.</p>
