It’s already above 30-celsius degree inside the building and they are complaining about how hot the weather is. Why do you complain about it when you are doing it willingly? I made ice cubes to have cool water every day in the past week. It is unbearable without AC to stay inside during daylight. However, it is fairly comfortable before 8-9am in the morning. I always walk/jog in the morning and buy breakfast before it gets too hot. There are several backers shops nearby, but I haven’t found any good tea yet. My family likes green tea that grows in a country where my grandparents live. It is too bitter for me.\nThe work pace here is faster than I expected. People usually don’t cut in line in the supermarket, but they will stand next to me and put their items on the counter when I’m talking with the cashier. The cashier will begin to scan their items when I am still taking out the cash. There are kiosks in banks that provide quick service, such as open or close accounts. Managers stand next to me and demand my ID and cards to operate the machine. Everything connects to the WeChat app, so people only need their cell phones to make payment. I like the idea of paying digitally, but I prefer not to use it. After three years of swiping cards and Apple Pay, I realized that I am less sensitive to the numbers. Digital payment tells the number of money I have and spend, but it doesn’t give a clear idea of how much I have and spend. The action of taking out cash and hand it to the cashier tells me that I used 5 dollars and I have 5 dollars less, but I can only see the “-5.00” on screen after I swipe the card. My parents praise highly on digital payment and laugh at me when I use the cash. They didn’t and wouldn’t understand even I tried to explain. They also don’t understand why the USA people don’t use an APP to make the payment. “American’s technology is not that developed, they still use card and cash.” No, technology is not the reason. It is the banks' benefits and third-party payment agreement. But I prefer not to explain these, I know they wouldn’t listen.\nHepburn I’ve been watch Hepburn’s old movie. The old movie is funny and romantic. That’s what Mr. David said. It’s quite common that a cunning fox man plays around with the girl, and probably lies and reveals his identity at the end. The girl never had experience before she meets this man, or it looks like she never had. Nicole Bonnet in How To Steal A Million loses her mind after Simon Dermott kissed her. The “oh what a man” face is funny and exaggerated. Nobody does that in real life. At least I haven’t seen anyone has such a funny face. Same to Charade. Ariane in Love in The Afternoon behave more normally. Mr. Frank attracts her and distracters her from her daily life. I also like what Eliza did to Professor Higgins in My Fair Lady. She keeps yelling “I’M A GOOD GIRL” and cries for help when the maids try to bath her. Well trained by the professor, Eliza successfully fools Karpathy the phonetics expert. When all the praise goes to Higgins, Eliza’s hard work is not recognized. Professor’s indifference to her future also irritates her. She throws slippers on Professor’s face. Nice one. When a girl can’t help fall in love with a man in the old movie, I tend to roll my eyes. Sabrina in Sabrina acts in the same way at the beginning, but then she stands up and becomes more confident and become helpless after 10 mins.\n","wordCount":"661","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2019-08-06T16:29:24+08:00","dateModified":"2019-08-06T16:29:24+08:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kyle Fang"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://endfang.github.io/posts/jibber-jabber-5/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"After1995","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://endfang.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script>

<p>One thing I don&rsquo;t understand about my family is why they like to drink hot tea and eat spicy food in hot weather. It&rsquo;s already above 30-celsius degree inside the building and they are complaining about how hot the weather is. Why do you complain about it when you are doing it willingly? I made ice cubes to have cool water every day in the past week. It is unbearable without AC to stay inside during daylight. However, it is fairly comfortable before 8-9am in the morning. I always walk/jog in the morning and buy breakfast before it gets too hot. There are several backers shops nearby, but I haven&rsquo;t found any good tea yet. My family likes green tea that grows in a country where my grandparents live. It is too bitter for me.</p>
