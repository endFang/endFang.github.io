I’m just glad that it is delivered without enormous problems. We met Yoshi-P in the Rising event again:\nThank you for bring us the XIV!\nMSQ This patch concluded the story of Shadowbringers very well. We brought back the night sky. We helped to bring back peace and order in Eulmore. We restored the name of Warrior of Light. We discovered the way to return to the Source, and we defeated Elidibus. If Zeno didn’t appear, I would say it could be the end of the story.\nThe reason why Elidibus encouraged people into the path of becoming a warrior of light is that he is the heart of Zodiark. Zodiark is summoned upon people’s wish of salvation during the Final Days. Warrior of Light is the hero who travels across the world to protect people and deliver the world from evil. Hence s/he becomes the embodiment of salvation. The more people walk in the path of heroism and wish for salvation, the more powerful Elidibus becomes. We were the 14th member of Convocation, Azem, the Traveler. Azem meant to explore the world and become intimate with the people and cultures. Instead of calling the Convocation, Azem would solve the problem with allies. Therefore, by the nature of believing man’s power, Azem opposed summoning Zodiark and left the office vacant.\nCrystal Exarch transformed into a crystal statue, but his soul and memories merge with G’raha in the Source. He wid’dll be with us in the longer term, I hope.\nWe had the pouring-water animation in 5.2, it was awesome. In this patch, we had a nice turn-around walking, Alisaie’s face-palm, Scion examining their weapons and garments, Krile’s bite of bread, Thancred capturing the bullet pouch. I think they used motion capture or other tools to create these natural movements.\n Lore We still don’t have the full picture of the Echo yet. After two patches of revelation, we know that Echo is not bestowed by Hydaelyn, and she is not only calling us but broadcasting the message to everyone. Having Echo is the prerequisite of hearing the calling. Everyone who is a sundered soul can access Echo when they recall the final days, which is triggered by seeing a scene of star shower.\nZodiark is summoned upon the wish of salvation by the Convocation during Final Days. Half of the Ancients sacrificed to perform the first summoning to prevent disaster and destruction. Another half sacrificed to bring back life and restore the cycle of nature in the second summoning. Convocation planned to summon Zodiark the third time to bring back their lost and loved ones by harvesting the new life in the world. However, some members disagree on the plan. Therefore, members who oppose the third summon, leading by Venat, summoned Hydaelyn, while other members, leading by Elidibus, summoned Zodiark. The result of the fight between the two primal is that Hydaelyn shattered the “very fabric of reality”, hence the world split into 13 reflections and the source.\nPuppet’s Bunker 2P was a copy of 2B created by the machine lifeforms. Pod repaired 2P with the parts we found in the disturbing corpse room. More white dressed android flew to Komra. They assaulted the carnival and exploded the mountain. 2P turned against, but 2B saved us in the last second. In the Puppet Bunker, P-units discovered Operator 21’s consciousness data and used it to control the pod. The final boss looks like the Legion from Castlevania. Of course, the concept is different. Legion is inspired by the exorcism of Gerasense demonic, while this boss, the Compound, is by the longing of having soul and reproduction. The boss’s title was 4c6f6e67696e67, which is “longing” in ASCII code. One of the attacks was also named “Reproduce”. After we defeat the orb form, it fell apart and reformed as a giant 2P.\nCrafting Dwarfing Time WoL might be one of those annoying people who is good at everything, but Ronitt form Tomra is going to be the best smith in Norvrandt. Ronitt plans to build a tank to help with transporting cargos in Lakeland, and we, as always, are going to help him with all sorts of chores. By the way, dwarfs have such a way with words and alliteration in abusing. “fluffy-beared nincompoop”, “hobgoblins”, “dundering dunderheads”, “simpleminded simpletons” …\nEhll Tou Ehll Tou is eager to help the Ishgardians and Dravanians to realize they could cooperate by becoming an artisan, so she became a miner, weaver, and culinarian. The story was fun, to see a dragonet using small tools, wearing a hat and scarf. It’s obvious that we can’t dress up a dragon, but the compensation is the Ehll Tou mount!\nBozjan Front The Bozjan Front is the new map just like Eureka, but an upgraded version. We can find forgotten fragments and memory of the dying. Fragments are the lost action only usable in Bozjan Front, like the logos action. Memory of the dying is for the relics upgrade. However, the Heavensward fates also drop the memory too, and it’s a guaranteed drop. Consider SE has made the trial account to HW content, I think this design is aiming to make the HW maps more lively. In fact, doing fates is faster compared to the Bozjan Front. Instead of experience, Bozjan use a mettle system. Doing Skirmish and Critical Engagement increase the mettles. The mettles rank won’t drop, but the mettles drops when the death occurs. This content dries up quicker than I expected. Unlike people were still forming the fate trains in Eureka Anemous before the Pagos release, people already stop doing it after 3 weeks. At least that’s my experience.\nG-Warrior The Ultima-like weapons use synthetic auracite as the core, like the Heart of Sabik to Ultima. Oversoul will result in the pilot being absorbed to the core and kill them in the process. This time we faced uncompleted Sapphire Weapon that has Regula van Hydrus’s battle data. Do not worry, because we are piloting G-Warrior!\nJibber-Jabber   Masayoshi Soken studied chemistry at the university but was hired as a sound editor in an arcade game company. He joined SE in 1998.\n  https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/i8i3x0/im_afraid_someone_at_se_may_be_a_tad_bit/\n-\n  Pressing buttons in the BGM’s beat is my new rotation as a DNC.\n  Blacklisted many assholes in progressing Seat of Sacrifice Extreme, and cleared it in the office during a lunch break.\n  Yokai-Watch: Fate grind again. Collect enough medals by doing fates in certain maps to exchange minions and weapons. I don’t watch Yokai Watch, and I think the minions, weapons, and mounts are silly and meh. I gave up after collected al the minions. However, for the first time in forever, Blue Mage shines in the game. Missle and Tail Screw destroyed every fate one by one on the whole map.\n  New Game+, Class Quests. We all know the Gladiator questline is better than the Paladin questline. I fully neglect the Arcaninst questline due to the eagerness of playing Astrologian back in 2015.\n  If we visit the Pedant again after the MSQ, we’ll meet an unexpected guest:   Fantasia! I’m tired of Au Ra’s hourglass body. It makes most body gears look weird and ugly. I don’t want to be a cat or a giant, and Lalafell is evil. That only left Hyur as the only option. Funny enough, most gears look great on Hyur. Meet the new Knox Whitetime.\n","wordCount":"1237","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2020-11-01T19:22:55+08:00","dateModified":"2020-11-01T19:22:55+08:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kyle Fang"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://endfang.github.io/posts/5-3grahatia/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"After1995","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://endfang.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script>

<p>Yokai-Watch: Fate grind again. Collect enough medals by doing fates in certain maps to exchange minions and weapons. I don&rsquo;t watch Yokai Watch, and I think the minions, weapons, and mounts are silly and meh. I gave up after collected al the minions. However, for the first time in forever, Blue Mage shines in the game. Missle and Tail Screw destroyed every fate one by one on the whole map.</p>

<p>New Game+, Class Quests.
We all know the Gladiator questline is better than the Paladin questline.
I fully neglect the Arcaninst questline due to the eagerness of playing Astrologian back in 2015.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m tired of Au Ra&rsquo;s hourglass body. It makes most body gears look weird and ugly. I don&rsquo;t want to be a cat or a giant, and Lalafell is evil. That only left Hyur as the only option. Funny enough, most gears look great on Hyur.
Meet the new Knox Whitetime.</p>
