For example, Bayonetta 2 is also an action game and has online multiplayer mode too. Similar to RWBY, it also has a relatively linear story, but the combo system and challenge mode make the game worth playing many times. Players can earn combo points when they keep attacking enemies. Points will be accumulated to estimated the medal at the end of each battle in single-player mode and to win rewards in multiplayer mode. Collecting enough\nhigh-value medal will reward certain hidden items and unlock a new higher difficulty mode. Players can perform very creative actions on enemies for scores or even simply for showing off. Meanwhile, the difficulty mode scales the game’s difficulty from “very easy” to “infinite climax”. Enemies have the stronger attack, more HP, and faster action when the difficulty is higher. This setting is to let players test or challenge their control skills and quick reaction. With these two mechanics, players can always play in a new way. The repetition hence becomes the main gaming experience that provides pleasure.\nIn conclusion, the level design in is linear and repetitive, and the rank system is simply redundant. RWBY’s repetition only brings pleasure at the beginning and ruins the fun game after that. Players will feel satisfied when they unlock the ability or achievement by repeating certain actions for the first time, but it is not interesting to lock these abilities and ask players to do it again.\n","wordCount":"680","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2018-06-04T23:26:01+08:00","dateModified":"2018-06-04T23:26:01+08:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kyle Fang"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://endfang.github.io/posts/rwby-linear-level-design-and-redundant-rank/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"After1995","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://endfang.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script>
