The 5.4 special website only revealed the first and second boss of Eden’s Promise. The third and fourth are supposed to be a surprise and not so easy to think of. According to the data mining, a creature mixed of Thancred and Ranjit will be a boss. They even data mined the music, but I did not listen. Story or Images spoilers are fine to me, but I’d rather keep the music as a surprise. The biggest surprise I’ve found in the spoilers is Alphinaud’s hairstyle. My guess is on the mog station cash shop and Heavensward outfit. It does look very dashing on a scholar.\nMSQ The MSQ is mostly centered on the cure of primal tempering. Allagan scholar Owen’s archive node record the study of Primal Corruption. According to the record, tempted souls' element alignment is shifted by exposing to the aether of primal. A long time exposure even changes the physical form. Based on this study and the help from the Ironwork Company, a cure magick is found by magitek terminals. This magick cures the soul and Alisaie’s Angelo cures the body. By imbuing this magick to Angelo, both cures will remove the primal tempering. In addition, Master Matoya help on create more Angelos by creating a Porxie Mother familiar, so Alisaie don’t need to cure one by one.\nAlliance leaders currently are working on making a peace between beastmen tribes. Aymeric is having a meeting with Vanu Vanu about cooperation. By curing the high priest of Kobold, Admiral Merlwyb finally having a change to restore the peace between the Kobold and Limsa’s pirates.\nMeanwhile, strange magitek towers suddenly appear across the world. Fandaniel made an dramatic entrance in Ala Mhigo and claimed to recreate the Final Days to destroy everything, including himself, in a very theatric way. He also demonstrated the power of “Lunar Bahamut” and delivered a message about Zeno. If WoL didn’t fight Zeno again, Lunar Bahamut will attack the cities in Eorzea. Later, he revealed that there are more other “beasts”.\nAnd Zeno did something, I guess. Never liked this character.\nBy the way, everyone in Rising Stone is talking about G’raha Tia. And I’m not that interested in him anymore. He is a developed character, played a vital part in Shadowbringers story, and is also well-received by almost the entire player base. However, I hope we can move on and be ready for the next expansion. Strange tower, the tempering, and the lunar pirmals, these are going to play a part in the next expansion.\nEden’s Promise Gaia and Ryne became very good friends. They made necklaces, bought lipsticks, and shared coffee biscuits. Ryne said they always share one biscuit by splitting it in half. Then she would buy another and share again … Why don’t you just buy two and you both can have a whole biscuit.\nIt turns out that Gaia is an reincarnated Ascian, Loghrif. The faerie kept whispering to her is her former Ascian partner, Mitron. Loghrif and Mitro were assigned to control the light in the First. To ensure the First would not become like the Void/Thirteenth, Ascians were actually preventing the Flood of Light. They joined together into an Ascian Prime but were defeated by Ardbert and his friends. Loghrif was destroyed by the Blade of Light, but Mitron transformed to the first Sin Eater by the heavy light element. Eden unleashed the Flood of Light, which is intercepted by Minfilia.\nMitron wanted Loghrif to come back, but Loghrif was long gone. Gaia is just Gaia and only wants to be Gaia. We defeated Eden. Before Mitron’s soul passed on, Gaia whispered a goodbye to “Artemis”.\nAscian’s name is the title of the seat in the Conviction. Emet-Selch, Elidibus, Lahabrea, Azim, all these are the seat titles. Now, we know some of theirs true names. Emet-Selch is Hades (Pluto), Loghrif is Gaia (the Earth), Mitron is Artemis (the Moon). It’s safe to assume that Ascian’s true names are from Greek Mythology and planet naming, and Azim’s true name might be Apollo or Helios (the Sun) by following this pattern.\nIt’s worth to note that Ryne wished to have Thancred and Urianger’s help while Thancred and Urianger left to Garlemald at the beginning of this Patch. They are out of reach of the WoL too.\nThe next physical DPS/Tank job will use a hammer for the weapon, because we can clearly see Gaia was holding her hammer in an exclusive fighting stance.\nVoid Quests Cylva wanted to keep other Warrior of Light. We shared the tales of Cylva’s tale with other bounty hunters and let them decide. The final decision, of course, it’s to let Warriors of Light stay in the First. Cylva mentioned Unukalhai when she said her attempt to save the Thirteenth, and she wondered what Unukalhai would do since Elidibus was gone, so we bought Unukalhai to the First! Unukalhai learned that Taynor can open portals to the void. He decided to walk on his own path and restore the Thirteenth. Taynor and Unukalhai began to practice the portal magick, and Beq Lugg created a porxie to collect information in the void. The plan works as intended, but the analysing the information takes a long time, maybe years. Unukalhai accepted the bounty hunter’s invitation and joined them.\nAt first, I thought the highlight between Unulkalhai and Nyelbert was because Unulkalhai did his trick on Nyelbert’s crystal and memory. Another possibility might be that they are the fragments of the same sundered souls?\nSince Yoshida mentioned that the next expansion is going to conclude the arc between Zodiark and Hydaelyn, the Thirteenth and other rejoined shards might be saved as well. Hopefully?\nSorrow of Werlyt Emerald Weapon used Gaius' data to fight against Warrior of Light in Castrum Marinum. Through the Echo, we see that Alphonse and other orphans' plan was to complete the Weapon Project and use the Weapon to destroy the Legatus Valens van Varro and the Empire. Milisandia, Ricon, Rex and Alphonse were all aware of the danger of Oversoul, except Allie. The next weapon is Diamond Weapon using Zeno’s data. Alphonse would be the pilot, because he forced Allied to escape by holding her in a cell. He wanted Gaius to find Allie and keep her safe in the abandoned Castrum Marinum. However, Valen’s plan was to trigger the Oversoul by themselves to control the Diamond Weapon.\nValen is a pure fascist and sadist. What he did to the children is horrible, unspeakable. There are several possibilities of his ending. Number one, WoL killed him. Number two, he’s defeated by WoL but was killed by his children. Number three, Diamond Weapon turned against him and killed him. I hope he had the worst ending.\nValen is the only NPC I would yell “put it back” when he took off the helmet.\nNier The blame of the destruction brought by the white dressed androids and the missing of Anogg made Konogg collapsed. He tried to do something for a dwarf and his dying wife by buying them a bottle of mead, but the dwarf did not want any of this. Konogg cried and ran away. He went into the Puppet’s Bunker and stood in front of a white orb. We saw that Anogg and Konogg in the Echo. Anogg saved Konogg in the tunnel’s falling down. When Konogg awoke from the coma, Anogg was nowhere to be found, but a pair of white gloves sat on the edge of a cliff. Konogg followed the tunnel and tried to find the Anogg, but he only found a strange white orb. A suspicious dwarf figure looked exactly like Anogg appeared from the orb. Konogg believed this is his sister.\nIshgard Crafting The last stage of the Ishgard Restoration arrived in 5.41. I neglected most of content in Firmament because the laziness the time-zone issue. It was not much to me since I was not into crafting much, but the game kept reminds me about the restoration, such as NPCs asking that if I took part the restoration. The rewards were quite good. There were emotes, paintings, and unique glamours. Luckily, these rewards were all tradable so I can buy part of them on the market board.\nThe steps of crafter/gatherer’s relics are fairly simple so far. It’s mostly gather the materials and craft certain items. Once I found the correct macro for the crafting, it’s simply push the one or two buttons and wait. HQ materials are incredibly helpful in here, because it will boost the base line of Collectability to above 1300.\nBlue Mage In 5.45, BLU finally got some update. 20 spells, a new Masked Carnival, and some quests were added. BLU is trying it best to become a Jack of all trades. Three role-specific spells, Matra Magic, Angel’s Snacks, and Dragon Force, added more flexibility in this job. Nevertheless, there is no spell stronger than White Wind that can increase enmity and heals like Benediction. No matter what healing spell is added, White Wind is just too good for AoE healing, and every BLU can use it without Healer Mimicry. Even though the game stated that BLU is a flexible job that can fit any role, BLU is still a DPS job. As a tank, its HP is too low. As a healer, everyone can heal to full HP in one spell without mimicry. Stotram is meaningless in current game content. It is weak on healing and dealing damage. Many other spells were useless and would never be cast because they are simply weaker.\nLaw’s Order The new resistance weapon upgrade requires ARR/HW/SB alliance raids grind. This is totally fine, except the Crystal Tower raid. It’s already the only raid in the Roulette and it’s a requirement for ShB MSQ, there’s no need to recycle it in the new relic weapon quest. Even though we have the option of grinding the fates, the drop rate is incredibly low.\nUpdate: After the update on 2.15, Castrum Lacus Litore would drop 5 Loathsome memory crystals. It was a tremendous boost on crystal framing now. It was true that full BLU Crystal Tower farm is faster than 3 hours Castrum, but I felt less tired on fighting in the Bozjan map compared to repeat the same raid 15 times repeating the same raid.\nA good thing was that I only need to farm HW and SB alliance. After the first relic, any followed relics only requires 3 Castrum runs.\nMisc Lalafell is evil Repeat after me, so it may really sink in. Lalafell is evil. Lalafell is evil. Lalafell is evil.\nDoman Mahjong I had no idea what I was doing, and the evil Moogle kept winning. Doman Mahjong is essentially Japanese Mahjong in Eorzea themed. My first attempt was to do whatever the hint suggested, but soon I found that the hint only resulted in losing to the ridiculous Moogle.\nOcean Fishing I can’t go to fish in the ocean in my will, because the Ocean Fishing has its own schedule. It is a mini game to catch more fishes to increase the scores. It will reward the XP and gatherer’s scrips. It’s not very interesting to me.\nHousing The trend of decorating housing is “library”. Yes, I understand people’s fantasy of being a smart person who reads tons of books. No, I do not think they actually read. I don’t like this mainstream design, so I made a house of “treasure hunter”.\n","wordCount":"1945","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2020-11-07T19:22:55+08:00","dateModified":"2020-11-07T19:22:55+08:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kyle Fang"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://endfang.github.io/posts/5-4-future-rewritten/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"After1995","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://endfang.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script>

<h1 id=intro>Intro<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#intro>#</a></h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m very glad when they announce Future Rewritten is on December 8, because I worried that it might get delayed like 5.3.</p>
<p>I do not mind the spoiler, so I checked the /ffxivdiscussion subreddit. The 5.4 special website only revealed the first and second boss of Eden&rsquo;s Promise. The third and fourth are supposed to be a surprise and not so easy to think of. According to the data mining, a creature mixed of Thancred and Ranjit will be a boss. They even data mined the music, but I did not listen. Story or Images spoilers are fine to me, but I&rsquo;d rather keep the music as a surprise.
The biggest surprise I&rsquo;ve found in the spoilers is Alphinaud&rsquo;s hairstyle. My guess is on the mog station cash shop and Heavensward outfit. It does look very dashing on a scholar.</p>

<p>The next physical DPS/Tank job will use a hammer for the weapon, because we can clearly see Gaia was holding her hammer in an exclusive fighting stance.</p>
<h1 id=void-quests>Void Quests<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#void-quests>#</a></h1>
<p>Cylva wanted to keep other Warrior of Light. We shared the tales of Cylva&rsquo;s tale with other bounty hunters and let them decide. The final decision, of course, it&rsquo;s to let Warriors of Light stay in the First. Cylva mentioned Unukalhai when she said her attempt to save the Thirteenth, and she wondered what Unukalhai would do since Elidibus was gone, so we bought Unukalhai to the First! Unukalhai learned that Taynor can open portals to the void. He decided to walk on his own path and restore the Thirteenth. Taynor and Unukalhai began to practice the portal magick, and Beq Lugg created a porxie to collect information in the void.
The plan works as intended, but the analysing the information takes a long time, maybe years. Unukalhai accepted the bounty hunter&rsquo;s invitation and joined them.</p>
<p>At first, I thought the highlight between Unulkalhai and Nyelbert was because Unulkalhai did his trick on Nyelbert&rsquo;s crystal and memory. Another possibility might be that they are the fragments of the same sundered souls?</p>
<p>Since Yoshida mentioned that the next expansion is going to conclude the arc between Zodiark and Hydaelyn, the Thirteenth and other rejoined shards might be saved as well. Hopefully?</p>

<p>Emerald Weapon used Gaius' data to fight against Warrior of Light in Castrum Marinum. Through the Echo, we see that Alphonse and other orphans' plan was to complete the Weapon Project and use the Weapon to destroy the Legatus Valens van Varro and the Empire. Milisandia, Ricon, Rex and Alphonse were all aware of the danger of Oversoul, except Allie. The next weapon is Diamond Weapon using Zeno&rsquo;s data. Alphonse would be the pilot, because he forced Allied to escape by holding her in a cell. He wanted Gaius to find Allie and keep her safe in the abandoned Castrum Marinum. However, Valen&rsquo;s plan was to trigger the Oversoul by themselves to control the Diamond Weapon.</p>

<p>Valen is a pure fascist and sadist. What he did to the children is horrible, unspeakable. There are several possibilities of his ending. Number one, WoL killed him. Number two, he&rsquo;s defeated by WoL but was killed by his children. Number three, Diamond Weapon turned against him and killed him. I hope he had the worst ending.</p>
<p>Valen is the only NPC I would yell &ldquo;put it back&rdquo; when he took off the helmet.</p>

<p>The blame of the destruction brought by the white dressed androids and the missing of Anogg made Konogg collapsed. He tried to do something for a dwarf and his dying wife by buying them a bottle of mead, but the dwarf did not want any of this. Konogg cried and ran away. He went into the Puppet&rsquo;s Bunker and stood in front of a white orb. We saw that Anogg and Konogg in the Echo. Anogg saved Konogg in the tunnel&rsquo;s falling down. When Konogg awoke from the coma, Anogg was nowhere to be found, but a pair of white gloves sat on the edge of a cliff. Konogg followed the tunnel and tried to find the Anogg, but he only found a strange white orb. A suspicious dwarf figure looked exactly like Anogg appeared from the orb. Konogg believed this is his sister.</p>
<h1 id=ishgard-crafting>Ishgard Crafting<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ishgard-crafting>#</a></h1>
<p>The last stage of the Ishgard Restoration arrived in 5.41. I neglected most of content in Firmament because the laziness the time-zone issue. It was not much to me since I was not into crafting much, but the game kept reminds me about the restoration, such as NPCs asking that if I took part the restoration. The rewards were quite good. There were emotes, paintings, and unique glamours. Luckily, these rewards were all tradable so I can buy part of them on the market board.</p>
<p>The steps of crafter/gatherer&rsquo;s relics are fairly simple so far. It&rsquo;s mostly gather the materials and craft certain items. Once I found the correct macro for the crafting, it&rsquo;s simply push the one or two buttons and wait. HQ materials are incredibly helpful in here, because it will boost the base line of Collectability to above 1300.</p>
<h1 id=blue-mage>Blue Mage<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#blue-mage>#</a></h1>
<p>In 5.45, BLU finally got some update. 20 spells, a new Masked Carnival, and some quests were added. BLU is trying it best to become a Jack of all trades. Three role-specific spells, Matra Magic, Angel&rsquo;s Snacks, and Dragon Force, added more flexibility in this job. Nevertheless, there is no spell stronger than <em>White Wind</em> that can increase enmity and heals like <em>Benediction</em>. No matter what healing spell is added, <em>White Wind</em> is just too good for AoE healing, and every BLU can use it without Healer Mimicry.
Even though the game stated that BLU is a flexible job that can fit any role, BLU is still a DPS job. As a tank, its HP is too low. As a healer, everyone can heal to full HP in one spell without mimicry. <em>Stotram</em> is meaningless in current game content. It is weak on healing and dealing damage. Many other spells were useless and would never be cast because they are simply weaker.</p>
<h1 id=laws-order>Law&rsquo;s Order<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#laws-order>#</a></h1>
<p>The new resistance weapon upgrade requires ARR/HW/SB alliance raids grind. This is totally fine, except the Crystal Tower raid. It&rsquo;s already the only raid in the Roulette and it&rsquo;s a requirement for ShB MSQ, there&rsquo;s no need to recycle it in the new relic weapon quest. Even though we have the option of grinding the fates, the drop rate is incredibly low.</p>
<p>Update:
After the update on 2.15, Castrum Lacus Litore would drop 5 Loathsome memory crystals. It was a tremendous boost on crystal framing now. It was true that full BLU Crystal Tower farm is faster than 3 hours Castrum, but I felt less tired on fighting in the Bozjan map compared to repeat the same raid 15 times repeating the same raid.</p>
<p>A good thing was that I only need to farm HW and SB alliance. After the first relic, any followed relics only requires 3 Castrum runs.</p>

<p>I had no idea what I was doing, and the evil Moogle kept winning.
Doman Mahjong is essentially Japanese Mahjong in Eorzea themed. My first attempt was to do whatever the hint suggested, but soon I found that the hint only resulted in losing to the ridiculous Moogle.</p>
<h2 id=ocean-fishing>Ocean Fishing<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ocean-fishing>#</a></h2>
<p>I can&rsquo;t go to fish in the ocean in my will, because the Ocean Fishing has its own schedule. It is a mini game to catch more fishes to increase the scores. It will reward the XP and gatherer&rsquo;s scrips. It&rsquo;s not very interesting to me.</p>
<h2 id=housing>Housing<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#housing>#</a></h2>
<p>The trend of decorating housing is &ldquo;library&rdquo;. Yes, I understand people&rsquo;s fantasy of being a smart person who reads tons of books. No, I do not think they actually read. I don&rsquo;t like this mainstream design, so I made a house of &ldquo;treasure hunter&rdquo;.</p>
