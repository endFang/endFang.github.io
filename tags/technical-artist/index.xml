      <description>Q; The ways of optimizting?
  Static Batching.
Objects are explicitly specified to be static. It can&amp;rsquo;t have any change in transform. It also requires additional memory to store combined geometry. 100 objects are 100 copy.
  Dynamic Batching
The mesh and materials need to be the same, and the mesh must have less than 300 vertices. The objects should not moving around. Shaders should have one pass. Instanced materials and lightmapping are not allowed.</description>

      <description>Achieving 60FPS on mobile, Youtube
Optimizing Graphics in Unity, Unity
Overdraw Overdrawn is to draw one pixel more than once. Post-processing will re-touch the pixel at least once. It adds burdens to the GPU and delays the frame.
Rendering is done by draw calls. The intermediate steps are not on the screen but in frame buffers. A frame buffer is a memory buffer that contains data representing the pixels in a complete video frame.</description>

      <description>Tutorials Editor folder contains any editor scripts. It allows no mono behavior scripts in it.
AssetPostprocessor is one of the editor class. One of the properties is assetPath, the path name of the asset being imported.
A series of function is called in the following order during the model import:
 OnPreprocessModel: I can override ModelImporter settings in here. After meshes and materials are imported, GameObjects hierarchy is created from the imported nodes.</description>
