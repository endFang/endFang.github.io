      <description>That was March. I was suffering from the poor project management and designer&amp;rsquo;s whimsical feature requirements. I started sending resumes and taking interviews and really got one position before the Qingming break. It was the best decision I made in Daydream Games. Now I don&amp;rsquo;t need to deal with the tightened project timeline and other nonsense.
It disappointed me that this game company did not want a technical artist but a cheap labor.</description>

      <description>Here I am. Writing about my depression. It&amp;rsquo;s coming back to me.
I almost believed that I do not need to write my dprs series anymore, because I did not feel depressed and anxious often. Nevertheless, they all jump back and hit me hard in the last several weeks.
The reason might be the job hunting, the anger towards the gov, the uncertainty, the nightmares, the longing, the lonesomeness, the irregular eating habit.</description>
